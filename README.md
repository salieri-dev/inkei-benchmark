# Inkei-Bench

**Inkei-Bench** is a specialized benchmark designed to evaluate Large Language Models on **cross-language code migration**, **complex geometric reasoning** to achieve the true **Artificial Genital Intelligence (AGI)**

Inspired by the impressive project of `inkei.net`, this benchmark challenges an LLM to interpret legacy JavaScript mathematics and port them into modern Python environments, or to generate complex biological parameterizations from scratch.
